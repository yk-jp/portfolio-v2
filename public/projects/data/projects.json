I tried hard to make the codebase readable and maintainable. To achieve that, I applied a dependency injection, MVC model, OOP, etc.",
    "difficulties": "This project was challenging for me. The most difficult parts I encountered were maintaining and updating player and table data in each room every time players take action. I focused on reusing the same functions and classes and testing the code base to deal with the complicated data flow properly and got over lots of hurdles on this project.",

    "difficulties": "At first, I hesitated to ask for an assignment of the issue to the OSS maintainers even though the issue was labelled as a \"good first issue\".  I encouraged myself to start the issue. I ran the codebase and checked all I needed in detail. That helped me to understand how the logic is structured. Every time I got feedback for the PR, I fixed the code and ran the test and I tried my best to leave easy-to-understand comments. My PR was successfully merged.",
